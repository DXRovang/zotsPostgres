# OLD TIMEY STRINGS

Welcome!

Old Timey Strings was conceived of as a Craigslist-style app that would offer American Folk Instruments (notably:  Banjos, Mandolins, and Guitars).

Once you've created an account, you'll be able to search the database for instruments and email the seller directly.   You'll also be able to post instruments that you own and would like to sell.

This application was created with Ruby on Rails, ERB, PostgreSQL, custom Bootstrap, and CSS.

We are currently in the process of deploying this application, but in the meantime feel free to run locally!

rails db:create
rails db:seed
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
http://127.0.0.1:3000/login

Happy shopping.    :)
